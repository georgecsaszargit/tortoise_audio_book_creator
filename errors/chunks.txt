These three regions are distinctly separate in human life. And man thereby becomes aware that he is interwoven with the world in a threefold way. The first way is something that he finds present and accepts as a given fact.
 Through the second way he makes the world into his own affair, into something that has a significance for himself. The third way he regards as a goal toward which he has unceasingly to strive.

Chapter 1. The Constitution Of The Human Being
~
Thefollowing words of Goethes describe, in a beautiful manner, the starting point of one of the ways by which the constitution of man can be known
`
When a person first becomes aware of the objects surrounding him, he observes them in relation to himself,
and rightly so, for his whole fate depends on whether they please or displease him, attract or repel, help or harm him. This quite natural way of looking at and judging things appears to be as easy as it is necessary.
Nevertheless, a person is exposed through it to a thousand errors which often cause him shame and embitter his life.
A far more difficult task do those undertake whose keen desire for knowledge urges them to strive to observe the objects of nature in themselves and in their relations to each other, for they soon miss the gauge which helped them when they, as persons,
regard the objects in reference tothemselvespersonally. They lack the gauge of pleasure and displeasure, attraction and repulsion, usefulness and harmfulness this gauge they have to renounce entirely.
They should, as dispassionate and, so to speak, divine beings, seek and examine what is, and not what gratifies. Thus the true botanist should not be affected either by the beauty or by the usefulness of the plants.
He has to study their structure and their relation to the rest of the vegetable kingdom and just as they are one and all enticed forth and shone upon by the sun, so should he with an equable, quiet glance look at and survey them all and obtain the gauge for this knowledge,
the data for his deductions, not out of himself, but from within the circle of things which he observes.
~
The thought thus expressed by Goethe directs attention to three kinds of things.
First, the objects concerning which information continually flows to man through the doors of his senses, those that he touches, smells, tastes, hears, and sees.
Second, the impressions which these make on him, and which record themselves as his pleasure and displeasure, his desire or abhorrence, according as he finds one harmonious, another inharmonious, one useful, another harmful.
Third, the knowledge and the experiences which he, as a sotospeak divine being, gains concerning the objectsthe secrets of their activities and their being which unveil themselves to him.
~
These three regions are distinctly separate in human life. And man thereby becomes aware that he is interwoven with the world in a threefold way. The first way is something that he finds present and accepts as a given fact.
Through the second way he makes the world into his own affair, into something that has a significance for himself. The third way he regards as a goal toward which he has unceasingly to strive.
~
Why does the world appear to man in this threefold way? The simplest consideration will explain that. I cross a Meadow covered with flowers. The flowers make their colors known to me through my eyes.
That is the fact which I accept as given. I rejoice in the splendor of the colors. Through this I turn the fact into an affair of my own. By means of my feelings I link the flowers with my own existence.
A year after I go again over the same meadow. Other flowers are there. New joy arises in me through them. My joy of the former year will appear as a memory. It is in me the object which aroused it in me is gone.
But the flowers which I. now see are of the same species as those I saw the year before they have grown in accordance with the same laws as did the others.
If I have enlightened myself regarding this species and these laws, I find them again in the flowers of this year as I recognized them in those of the former year. And I shall perhaps muse as follows
`
The flowers of last year are gone my joy in them remains only in my remembrance.
It is bound up withmyexistence alone. That, however, which I recognized in the flowers of the former year and recognize again this year, will remain as long as such flowers grow. That is something that revealed itself to me, but which is not dependent on my existence in the same way as my joy is.
My feelings of joy remain in me the laws, thebeingof the flowers, remain outside of me in the world.
~
Man continually links himself in this threefold way with the things of the world.
One should not for the time being read anything into this fact, but merely take it as it presents itself. It makes it evident that man hasthree sides to his nature. This and nothing else will for the present be indicated here by the three wordsbody,soul, andspirit.
He who connects any preconceived meanings, or even hypotheses, with these three words will necessarily misunderstand the following explanations.
Bybodyis here meant that by which the things in the environment of a man reveal themselves to him, as in the example just cited, the flowers of the meadow.
By the wordsoulis signified that by which he links the things to his own being, through which he experiences pleasure and displeasure, desire and aversion, joy and sorrow.
Byspiritis meant that which becomes manifest in him when, as Goethe expressed it, he looks at things as a sotospeak divine being. In this sense the human being consists ofbody,soul, andspirit.
~
Through his body man is able to place himself for the time being in connection with the things through his soul he retains in himself the impressions which they make on him through his spirit there reveals itself to him what the things retain in themselves.
Only when one observes man in these three aspects can one hope to gain light on his whole being. For these three aspects show him to be related in a threefold way to the rest of the world.
~
Through his body he is related to the objects which present themselves to his senses from without. The materials from the outer world compose this body of his and the forces of the outer world work also in it.
And just as he observes the things of the outer world with his senses, he can also observe his own bodily existence. But it is impossible to observe the soul existence in the same way.
All occurrences connected with my body can be perceived with my bodily senses. My likes and dislikes, my joy and pain, neither I nor anyone else can perceive with bodily senses. The region of the soul is one which is inaccessible to bodily perception.
The bodily existence of a man is manifest to all eyes the soul existence he carries within himself as HIS world. Through thespirit, however, the outer world is revealed to him in a higher way.
The mysteries of the outer world, indeed, unveil themselves in his inner being but he steps in spirit out of himself and lets the things speak about themselves, about that which has significance not for him but forthem.
Man looks up at the starry heavens the delight his soul experiences belongs to him the eternal laws of the stars which he comprehends in thought, inspirit, belong not to him but to the stars themselves.
~
Thus man is citizen ofthree worlds. Through hisbodyhe belongs to the world which he perceives through his body through hissoulhe constructs for himself his own world through hisspirita world reveals itself to him which is exalted above both the others.
~
It is evident that because of the essential differences of these three worlds, one can obtain a clear understanding of them and of mans share in them only by means of three different modes of observation.

This volume contains translations of the socalled Leading Thoughts, brief paragraphs dealing with Anthroposophy as a Path of Knowledge.
They were written by Rudolf Steiner for Members of the Anthroposophical Society and at a later stage were accompanied by communications known as the Letters connected with sets of Leading Thoughts.
 Articles with contents of a quite different kind, dealing with the character, aims and problems of the Society, are published separately, in two volumes entitled The Life, Nature and Cultivation of Anthroposophy and The Constitution of the School of Spiritual Science.

In beginning to understand candida fully as adisease it is enlightening to examine the behaviour of candida as apathogen and it is, perhaps, initially most useful to consider the morphology or the biological structure and makeup of this pathogen.
~
Candida can exist in two distinct formsit can exist as ayeast and also as afungus. It is also quite important, as astarting point, to realize that many other dangerous pathogens coexist in the lower human intestines along with candida in whatscalled asymbiotic state.
Symbiotic means that the invading organism benefits as well as the host from the dual relationship.
The invading pathogen does no real harm to the host because the hostsimmune system and healthy body state are fully capable of maintaining ahealthy defensive environment for the host, thus suppressing invading organisms,
thereby preventing these pathogens from morphing or changing into amore dangerous or damaging pathogenic form. There are also many other potentially dangerous pathogens that continually and naturally inhabit our lower intestines such as E.
 coli, Giardia, Salmonella, H. pylori etc. that coexist in asuppressed and controlled state as harmless symbionts within the lower intestinal area, which can only ever be attributed to the actual strong health state of the human host.

My doctor says that he she doesntbelieve in chronic candidiasis is astatement that many patients have relayed to me.
The latest textbooks continue to treat yeast as more of anuisance than as asignificant cause of chronic ill health, the principal exception being the instances of deep formerly systemic candidiasis associated primarily with diseases of the cells of the immune system itself HIV, leukemia, lymphoma,

You are making abig mistake if you do not heed this warning.
If bacteria and viruses are the regular enemy troops that attack our bodies and our immune system, then you should regard candida as their Special Forces or as ahighly competent guerrilla terrorist force that can hide in your body using biofilms candida can breed with the host cells,
thereby easily adjusting to medicines candida can cause cravings in its host for its favourite food

It is both asaprophytic yeast and afungal parasite with adual form3740 that is always associated with many other pathogenic forms and diseases15, 19, 32, 35 and one that uses superior chemical warfare to continually weaken our immune system via its waste products,

The external mucus glands consisting of all the above mucus glands with the exception of the prostate and breasts may be regarded as the human bodys first essential line of defense against all incoming pathogens.
|
I have already made clear the point that candida infections can arise from dysbiosis or from a poor diet. What can also aid in both the infection and rapid spread of candida is an already weakened, immunocompromised or susceptible immune system.
For this to be fully understood and made clear, I will need to quickly describe how the mucus glands normally aid in the defense of the body from outside pathogen attack.
|
Among the main defensive mechanisms throughout the body are the immune system phagocytes, which act to engulf and continually destroy invasive pathogens. These mucus glands also have two forms of such leukocytes neutrophils and eosinophils that help protect against extraneous pathogen attack.
|
The defensive action against pathogens by both the neutrophils and eosinophils is quite similar. The neutrophils use the myeloperoxidase enzyme MP and the eosinophils use the eosinophil peroxidase enzyme EP to mediate in the destruction of pathogens such as candida, viruses and bacteria.
 For ease of understanding, I will only describe how the neutrophil reacts against and kills pathogens.

Interviewer, Can you tell us about your motivation behind writing this book?
|
Author, One of the main reasons for writing this book is my personal experience as an exsystemic candida sufferer.
I found that modern medicines approach to diagnosing and treating candida to be inadequate, so I took it upon myself to learn more about the condition and share my findings with others.
|
Interviewer, What is your background, and what qualifies you to write about candida?
|
Author, My background is as a layperson who has personally dealt with candida and cured myself using a specific multiremedy methodology.
While I am not a qualified doctor, I consider myself a logical person who enjoys reading and deciphering medical research to find effective treatments for various health issues.
|
Interviewer, How does the book aim to help readers dealing with candida?
|
Author, The book aims to simplistically define and explain what candida is as a pathogen, while presenting several proven remedies that can effectively help cure all forms of candida. This includes localized candida, intestinal candida, and systemic or disseminated candida.

Concepts appear first with the Greeks, and even then they seem to have reached only into things of the intellect, logic, geometry, and philosophy only with the arrival of the scientific revolution.
A new power seemed to unfold in us. Suddenly we could comprehend that the same force that makes the apple fall also holds the moon in orbit. The excitement of discovering that new inner capacity swept all before it.

What could be understood with this new capacity was Science with a capital S what could not was considered faith, religion, or superstition, according to one s point of view.

Initially, Science consisted of physics and astronomy.

We and the world around us evolve. This evolution is nowhere more marked than in our own consciousness. When we try to enter into the religious texts of the ancient Egyptians, we have to admit that they are total enigmas to us.
|
Our science would almost certainly be equally incomprehensible to them. They were, for example, obvious masters of what, in physics today, we call force however, they used it in a completely intuitive way, without any concept of it.
|
They may well have had visions of force, but no concept.
